        <item> ðŸ¦’ They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer
            distances.
        </item>
        <item>ðŸ¦’ Giraffes ðŸ¦’  spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.</item>
        <item>The giraffe calf ðŸ¦’  can stand up and walk after about an hour and within a week, it starts to sample
            vegetation.
        </item>
        <item>Despite the females\â€™ attempts to stand over their calves during attacks by lions, spotted hyenas, leopards
            and African wild dogs (4), many calves are killed in their first few months.
        </item>
        <item>A giraffe\â€™s ðŸ¦’ spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same
            pattern.
        </item>
        <item> ðŸ¦’ Giraffes ðŸ¦’  only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps
            that may last only a minute or two at a time.
        </item>
        <item>Whilst it was thought that ðŸ¦’ giraffes ðŸ¦’  did not make any sounds, this is now known to be untrue, as giraffes
            bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds, as well as low pitch noises beyond the range of human
            hearing.</item>
        <item>
        There are four distinct species of giraffe: Northern giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis, Southern giraffe giraffa, Reticulated giraffe G. reticulata and Masai giraffe G. tippelskirchi.</item>
        <item>Giraffe ðŸ¦’ are already extinct in at least seven countries in Africa.</item>

        <item>Giraffe ðŸ¦’ feet are the size of a dinner plate with a diameter of 30 cm.</item>
        <item>Giraffe ðŸ¦’ tongues are bluish-purple and between 45 and 50 cm long.</item>
        <item>Both male and female giraffe ðŸ¦’ have horns already at birth. These ossicones lie flat and are not attached to the skull to avoid injury at birth. They only fuse with the skull later in life.</item>
        <item>The giraffe ðŸ¦’ is the tallest mammal in the world. Even newborn giraffe are taller than most humans.</item>
        <item>Female giraffe ðŸ¦’ give birth standing up. Their young fall about 2 m to the ground and can stand up within an hour of birth.</item>
        <item>In some populations, over 50% of all giraffe ðŸ¦’ calves do not survive their first year.</item>
        <item>A giraffe\â€™s ðŸ¦’ neck is too short to reach the ground. To drink, giraffe first have to splay their forelegs and/or bend their knees, and only then can they lower their necks to reach the surface of the water.</item>
        <item>Giraffe ðŸ¦’ only drink once every few days. Even when water is readily available, evidence shows that many giraffe do not drink regularly â€“ sometimes not at all.</item>
        <item>To protect the giraffe\â€™s ðŸ¦’ brain from sudden changes in blood pressure when it lowers its head to drink, it has valves to stop the back-flow of blood and elastic-walled vessels that dilate and constrict to manage flow. NASA has done research on the blood vessels in giraffe legs to get inspiration for human space suits.</item>
        <item>A giraffe ðŸ¦’ heart weighs approximately 11 kilograms and is the biggest of any land mammal. It is used to pump 60 litres of blood around its body every minute at a blood pressure twice that of an average human.</item>
